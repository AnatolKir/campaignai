2. **Logical groupings** that match user mental models
3. **Fewer decisions** but more comprehensive options
4. **Built-in conflict prevention** through smart option combinations
5. **Progressive disclosure** - advanced users can still fine-tune

2. Map existing data to new structure with migration logic
3. Update conflict matrix to match new field names
4. Add explanatory tooltips for complex combined options
