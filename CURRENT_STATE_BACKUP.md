# Current State Backup - Pre-Cursor Update

## Files Modified During Port Management Crisis

### PORTS.md Contents

# Port Management for CampaignAI Projects

## Current Port Assignments
- **Campaign AI (Main)**: Port 3000 (default)
- **Coming Soon Site**: Port 3007 (working)
- **ChatAI**: Port 3001 (blocked by conflicts)
- **Vigo-Local**: Port 3002 (blocked by conflicts)

## Zombie Processes Found
Multiple Node.js processes are occupying ports 3000-3007:
- PIDs: 70383, 70403, 71148, and others
- All running variations of "next dev" with auto-port-finding
- Resistant to standard kill commands

## Failed Solutions
1. Multiple `pkill -f "next dev"` commands
2. Port management scripts creating infinite loops
3. start-all.sh script making situation worse
4. Manual port assignment blocked by existing processes

## Status
- ‚ùå Main Campaign AI: Cannot start
- ‚úÖ Coming Soon Site: Working on port 3007
- ‚ùå ChatAI: Cannot start
- ‚ùå Vigo-Local: Cannot start

## Next Steps
Remove port management system entirely - it's causing more problems than it solves.

### scripts/fix-port-assignments.sh Contents
```bash
#!/bin/bash
# Port conflict resolution script - BECAME PROBLEMATIC

echo "üîß Fixing port assignments for all projects..."

# Kill existing processes
pkill -f "next dev" || true
pkill -f "next start" || true

# Wait for processes to die
sleep 3

# Check for remaining processes
echo "Checking for remaining processes..."
ps aux | grep -E "(next|node)" | grep -v grep

# This script became part of the problem by creating infinite loops
echo "WARNING: This script has become problematic and should be removed"
```

### scripts/start-all.sh Contents
```bash
#!/bin/bash
# Multi-project startup script - MADE THINGS WORSE

echo "üöÄ Starting all projects..."

# This script tried to start multiple projects simultaneously
# but created more port conflicts instead of solving them

cd /Users/ricklatona/Desktop/campaignainew
echo "Starting Campaign AI on port 3000..."
npm run dev &

cd /Users/ricklatona/Desktop/campaignainew/coming-soon-site
echo "Starting Coming Soon site on port 3007..."
PORT=3007 npm run dev &

cd /Users/ricklatona/Desktop/chatai
echo "Starting ChatAI on port 3001..."
PORT=3001 npm run dev &

cd /Users/ricklatona/Desktop/vigo-local
echo "Starting Vigo-Local on port 3002..."
PORT=3002 npm run dev &

echo "All projects started in background"
echo "WARNING: This script made the port conflicts worse"
```

### Package.json Scripts Modified
The following package.json files may have been modified with port management:
- `/Users/ricklatona/Desktop/campaignainew/package.json`
- `/Users/ricklatona/Desktop/campaignainew/coming-soon-site/package.json`
- `/Users/ricklatona/Desktop/chatai/package.json` (if exists)
- `/Users/ricklatona/Desktop/vigo-local/package.json` (if exists)

### Next.config Files
May have been modified to handle port conflicts:
- `/Users/ricklatona/Desktop/campaignainew/next.config.ts`
- `/Users/ricklatona/Desktop/campaignainew/coming-soon-site/next.config.js`

## Key Issues Identified
1. **Zombie Process Problem**: Standard kill commands not working
2. **Port Management Backfire**: The solution became the problem
3. **Infinite Loop Scripts**: Scripts checking ports endlessly
4. **Multiple Project Interference**: Projects fighting each other

## Recommendation
**REMOVE ALL PORT MANAGEMENT CODE** and return to default Next.js configurations. The complexity has become counterproductive.
